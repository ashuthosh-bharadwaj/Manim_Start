# Manim_Start
An extremely hurried effort to learn enough manim community and for good reason (I hope)


## Running the file:
At the terminal, get to the directory where the file is and run 
```
manim -pqh Trial.py THEONE
```
to render the animation. It should produce an output very similar to the one stored in `./Videos/Main.mp4` (Some randomness was involved in the making of the graph signals)


## More updates:
I plan to write a ton of more manim community/ maybe even 3b1b manim files soon, please stay tuned.
