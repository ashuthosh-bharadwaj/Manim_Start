# Manim_Start
An extremely hurried effort to learn enough manim community and for good reason (I hope)

## Where I procured lore:
A few links helped a TON, here they are:
- This video by [Tony Zhang](https://github.com/Tony1324): [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOXmbB-Uqmc)
- This set of videos by PapaFlammy and Vivek (vcubingx) (These were for the other version but I was less than aware at the moment): [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jfgtl-AW5Oc&list=PLN2B6ZNu6xmeRb0GPGW7dN05u2OXD_6h6&t=0s)
-  And ofcourse nothing like the docs out there for this brilliant engine: [Link](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html)

This series started recently by one of the main developers of Manim CE [Benjamin Hackl](https://github.com/behackl) and his repository containing the same were extremely useful in understasting the core structure of ManimCE. 



## Running the file:
At the terminal, get to the directory where the file is and run 
```
manim -pqh Trial.py THEONE
```
to render the animation. It should produce an output very similar to the one stored in `./Videos/Main.mp4` (Some randomness was involved in the making of the graph signals)


## More updates:
I plan to write a ton of more manim community/ maybe even 3b1b manim files soon, please stay tuned.

## Update:
A few more videos were generated following the submission for 5-MICC @ ICASSP 2022
